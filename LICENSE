The program code in the 'em-tftp' repository has been placed in the public domain. You can do anything you want with it, anything at all. Just let your imagination run wild!

If you don't believe in this 'public domain' thing, then you can use this code under the CC0 (creative commons) license. If that's still not good enough... sheesh, just write me an e-mail or something, and we'll see what can be worked out, OK?
